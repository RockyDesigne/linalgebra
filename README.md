# linalgebra
A program to solve linear systems of equations that have a unique solution, using the Gauss method of elimination.

## What it does
- Reads the number of matrices from a file, and for each matrix it calculates the solutions of the system
- It is fast
- Uses fractions to represent floating point numbers

## Limitations
- It does not solve indeterminate systems
